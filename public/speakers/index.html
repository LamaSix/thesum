Nascent time spent in this wonderland setting has inspired his life and work ever since. In 2000 he created the iconic Oaklandish campaign, a covert street-operation designed to raise awareness about the unique cultural legacy of the Town.  Next, he launched the Jejune Institute, a ground breaking immersive narrative experiment, which is now the subject of an award-winning documentary film.  He is the creative director of the Situational Design studio, Nonchalance, which is engrossed with the launch of their next mysterious offering.
